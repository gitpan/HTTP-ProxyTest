HTTP-ProxyTest version 0.11
===========================

Robots that send comment spam are often hidden behind anonymous open
proxy servers. You can use HTTP::ProxyTest to look for open proxies
on-the-fly and prevent such spam robots from submitting their crap.
The module is particularly useful if you don't want to bother your
web site visitors with CAPTCHAs etc.

HTTP::ProxyTest tests certain ports of REMOTE_ADDR that are often
used for anonymous open proxies, and denies access if an open proxy
is found, i.e. it responds with status "403 Forbidden" and exits.
